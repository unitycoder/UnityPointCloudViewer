*** PointCloud Viewer & Tools for Unity ***

v2.20

- Feature: Add new tiles binary format (v3) (allows displaying huge point clouds using point lod system *Consider this as a "beta" feature)
- Feature: PointCloud2Binary Converter: Add option to limit total imported point count (ideal for quickly testing import settings)
- Feature: PointCloud2Binary Converter: Support large input files (tested 16gb ply file, with 432million points)
- Feature: PointCloud2Mesh Converter: Meshes are saved as full gameobjects (instead of mesh assets only) when [x] Add meshes to current scene is enabled. Note: Not supported for LODS yet

- Improved: PointCloud2Binary Converter: Add Cancel button to most of the conversion progressbars
- Improved: Add more info into converter progress bars (pointcounts)
- Improved: Add more validation and error checking here & there (will print to console)
- Improved: Add cancel button to random cloud generator progress bars

- Added: Example scene for v3 viewer: PointCloudTools/Demos/PointCloudViewer/Scenes/PointCloud-TilesViewerV3.scene

- Changed: Upgraded Project to Unity 2017.4.24f1 (probably will stay in this version for a while)

- Fixed: Various PLY importer issues (cloudcompare headers)
- Fixed: Single .pts/.pcd cloud with less than 1000 points was skipped on import
- Fixed: PointCloudConverter: Calculate correct bounds for v2 pointcloud
- Fixed: Using intensity colors now works with V2 format
- Fixed: Reading CGO data without RGB values into V2 format
- Fixed: Added conditional check for reprecated rendering in 2019_1 and later
- Fixed: Nullref error on random point cloud save cancel
- Fixed: Skip Geomagic ASC file header comment rows
- Fixed: v2 cancel loading if no RGB data in file

- Note: When converting large clouds into v3 format, its better to use commandline LAS/LAZ converter (432m points, editor=~50mins, cmdline=~10mins) https://github.com/unitycoder/UnityPointCloudViewer/wiki/Commandline-Tools

- Fixed: Created meshes now have disabled light and blend probes (since those features are not used)
- Fixed: Fixed missing script error in "scene_VideoDepthExtrude.scene"
- Fixed: MeshConverter failed with large clouds (because PointData struct used too much memory)
- Fixed: `System.IO.File' does not contain a definition for `ReadAllBytes' (Caused by having SamsungTV as target platform)

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

v1.7

- Added: PointCloud2Mesh now has basic LOD mesh generation (with adjustable LOD amount)
- Added: Link for custom PointMeshSizeDX11 shaders (can adjust point size for mesh points in DX11 mode, since point size is not supported in DX11) *See Materials/Shaders/Extras-folder)

- Fixed: Unity5.2 or later couldnt set output filename in save dialog
- Fixed: CloudCompare PLY file had extra comment in header, it gets correctly skipped now

- Note: LOD meshes are not saved to project folder, they currently live in the scene only
- Note: Optimize Points & Decimate points are not supported with Brekel PointCloud2Binary importer

- Known issues: Optimize Points does not work properly, loses precision in some cases

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

- Added: Display selected file size (below sourcefile field)
- Added: **Experimental** [x] Optimize Points for PointCloud2Mesh (easier to see from scene view while playing), it sorts the points along X axis (to allow mesh pieces to get culled easier), but doesnt work well with all values, if your cloud seems to be missing points, disable Optimize points.

- Changed: Project is now updated to Unity5.1
- Changed: Point data is now internally read as doubles instead of floats (to avoid loss of precision during scaling)
- Changed: DX11 viewer & DX11 shaders now use less memory

- Fixed: PointCloud2Mesh AutoOffset (it didnt work if FlipYZ was not enabled)
- Fixed: Fixed several parsing problems with some files (.asc, .pts, .las, .xyz)
- Fixed: .LAS colors values are now scaled to 0-255 (some files had different ranges)

- Note: DX11 Point clouds doesnt seem to work if Unity v5.x "[x] Virtual Reality Supported" is enabled
- Note: DX11 point clouds or Mesh point clouds doesnt seem to work with WebGL viewer

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

- Changed: BinaryViewer now automatically adds ".bin" to end of the file, if its missing in the inspector field
- Changed: .ASC reader now tries to skip all comment lines from start of the file (to allow reading Geomagic .asc files)

- Fixed: Manual offset values (had .x for all axis, instead of .x .y .z)
- Fixed: BinaryConverter now removes double or triple spaces between values, to fix Geomagic .asc import

- Note: MeshConverter does not yet support .LAS or .PTS importing (use some external tools to convert them to another supported format)
